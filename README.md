# Apple Retail Sales SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Apple Retail Sales Dataset** using SQL to uncover insights about store performance, revenue growth, and regional profitability.  
The goal was to practice SQL data analysis techniques — including joins, aggregations, and filtering — and to create meaningful **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that reflect real-world business metrics.

## Dataset Information
**Source:** [Apple Retail Sales Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amangarg08/apple-retail-sales-dataset)  
The dataset includes information about:
- Store locations and regions  
- Product categories and prices  
- Sales transactions and quantities  
- Expenses and profit data  

---

## Objectives
The main objective was to use SQL to:
- Calculate business metrics (KPIs) related to sales performance.  
- Identify top-performing stores and regions.  
- Analyze trends in revenue and profitability over time.  
- Strengthen practical SQL skills for data analytics and portfolio work.

## KPIs Calculated
1. **Total Revenue by Year**  
2. **Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**  
3. **Top 5 Stores by Total Revenue**  
4. **Average Profit Margin by Country**  
5. **Expense-to-Revenue Ratio by Year**  
6. **Revenue per Unit Sold**

## SQL Concepts Used
- `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)  
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `HAVING`  
- Creating and querying **views** for organized analysis

## Results Summary

- Identified the top 3 stores by total revenue, with **[Apple The Dubai Mall, Apple Orchard Road, Apple Central World]** generating the highest sales overall.  
- Found that **[HomePod mini]** contributed the most to overall revenue, indicating strong customer demand in that area.  
- Discovered that stores in the **[United States]** consistently outperformed others in total quantity sold.  
- Analyzed average price and quantity sold to identify potential pricing or inventory optimization opportunities.  
- Created a SQL view to consolidate key metrics (total revenue, quantity sold, and expenses) for easier analysis and reporting.
